# Dice_Rolling

Trying to be better at putting things I write onto GH, so here's a dice roller for a specific character. Calling dagger() rolls 4d20, adds to-hit modifiers, rolls a bunch of damage dice, and outputs 2 arrays, one of the to-hit rolls, and the other of summed damage. The roll array also tetlls you if it was a crit, a 20, or a 1.

Calling allOut() is similar, it just has one more attack+damage pair.
